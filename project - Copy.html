                <p class="heading1">A calculator 📟 is a device or application designed for performing mathematical
                    calculations. It typically includes buttons for digits, arithmetic operations (addition,
                    subtraction, multiplication, division), and additional functions like clear or equals. The user
                    inputs numbers and operations, and the calculator displays or outputs the result of the computation.
                    Calculators can be physical handheld devices or software applications, and they are widely used for
                    various mathematical tasks in everyday life and professional settings.<br><br>
